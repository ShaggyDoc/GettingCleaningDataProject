README

created 21/02/2015

This README accompanies tidydata.txt and run_analysis.R

Data was sourced from the links provided in the course project page:
	
	https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Once the zip file is expanded, a folder named 'UCI HAR Dataset' will be available.  This contains all the .txt data files required for the project.

This folder needs to be placed in your R working directory.

run_analysis.R is code that tidies the data in the UCI HAR Dataset folder as per the project instructions.

The output is a data table 'tidydata', which provides a list of averages measured for each subject for each activity.

The author acknowledges the run_analysis code is inefficient.  He has identified areas for improvement.  These areas will be revised to improve efficiency as time allows.
